- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ivan7000
- 👀 I am interested in creating interesting programs and websites. I can be called a full stack developer because I work alone on all projects. I know programming languages such as flutter, kotlin and python. I know all these languages at an intermediate level.
- 🌱 I am currently in school and have almost graduated.
- 💞️ I am not looking for opportunities for cooperation because I am not very cool in programming and if someone wants to cooperate, but there are such people, then I will not mind.
- 📫 You can contact me via reddit or telegram.
